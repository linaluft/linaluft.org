    <h1> This Page is a political blog of me (Lina Luft), an activist of the planetary peace movement (PPM) <h1>
      My central goal is a planetary (worldwide) peaceful togetherness of humanity and nature. 
      Under this view the faced problems are subdevided into two main categories within my blog: human-human conflicts and human-nature conflicts. 
      
      I'm relatively new in web pageing. I hope you can still enjoy the presented content. Let's get started :P
